# Automatic Company Brochure Generator

## Description

This project is a Python command-line tool that automatically generates marketing brochures for companies based on the content of their websites. It utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and summarize key information about a company, its culture, customers, and career opportunities.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automatically fetches content from a company's homepage and other identified subpages (e.g., "About Us," "Careers").
- **Intelligent Link Analysis**: Uses an LLM to identify the most relevant links on a website to create a comprehensive brochure.
- **Content Generation**: Employs an advanced language model to create a coherent and engaging brochure in Markdown format.
- **Customization**: Easily specify the target company and its URL by modifying the `main.py` file.

## Sample Brochures

Below are sample brochures generated by the project (Markdown files). Click to open the file in an editor or a Markdown-capable viewer:

- [Amazon](output/Amazon_Brochure.md)
- [Binance](output/Binance_Brochure.md)
- [Coursera](output/Coursera_Brochure.md)
- [Google](output/Google_Brochure.md)
- [Space X](output/Space_X_Brochure.md)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
	``` bash
	git clone https://github.com/your-user/your-repository.git
	cd your-repository
	```

2. **Install dependencies:**
	``` bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

3. **Configure your API key:**
- Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory.
- Add your OpenAI API key to it in the following format:    

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key'
    ```

## Usage

1. **Set the target company:**
- Open the `main.py` file.
- Change the values of the `COMPANY_NAME` and `URL` variables to the name and website address of the company for which you want to generate the brochure.

    ``` python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        COMPANY_NAME = 'Coursera'
        URL = "https://coursera.org"
        create_brochure(COMPANY_NAME, URL)
    ```
    
2. **Run the script:**

	```
	python main.py
	```

1. **Find the output:**
- The generated brochure will be saved in the `output/Brochure.md` file.
